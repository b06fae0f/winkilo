# WinKilo

WinKilo is based on the kilo text editor by [@antirez](https://github.com/antirez), it relies on the Windows API to handle inputs and therefore it works only for Windows OS.

Original code for kilo editor works for UNIX based systems such as Linux and MacOS, therefore it doesn't compile using the Microsoft C++ (MSVC) compiler.

WinKilo code was copied from the kilo-tutorial and therefore all rights reserved to the original authors of kilo.
